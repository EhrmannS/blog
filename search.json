I believe that anything can, and should be explained so that even my grandmother can understand it; also interoperability.\nAs you sow, you shall reap is a statement I believe in, which is also a nice transition to the overarching topic I am dealing with mostly in my academic work; agro-ecology, land-system science and macroecology. Also the ecology of infectious diseases is close to my heart (I wrote my PhD Thesis about it), so this will occasionally also be the topic here.\nIn case you are into any of those topics, I hope you enjoy your time here, and encourage you to participate in discussions or challenge what I wrote!\nYou can also find me on google scholar, github, researchgate, linkedin or @DerEhrmann.\n\n\n\n",
