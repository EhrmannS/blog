On this website I want write about anything that is related to my passion of human-nature interactions and my obsession of making data and tools interoperable. I believe that anything can, and should be explained so that even my grandmother can understand it; also interoperability (ok, she is dead alreadyâ€¦ but I hope you get what I mean). I guess every now and then I will also not hold back with cynicism and critical thoughts about academia or the system we scientist dwell in and I hope you, the reader, also find this entertaining. And perhaps it also helps, after all as you sow, you shall reap, which is a nice transition to the overarching topic I am dealing with mostly in my academic career; agro-ecology, land-system science and macroecology. So in case you are into any of those topics, I hope you enjoy reading one or the other blog-post I am gonna post or have already posted.\nYou can also find me on google scholar, github, researchgate, linkedin or @DerEhrmann.\n\n\n\n",
